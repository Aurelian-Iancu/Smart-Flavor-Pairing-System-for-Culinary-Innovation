 Bachelor Thesis

Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor Thesis, submitted to the Faculty of Computer Science at Babe»ô-Bolyai University (UBB).

## Overview

This repository contains the research, documentation, and code developed for my Bachelor Thesis. It represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, where I explored the development of a **Smart Flavor Pairing System for Culinary Innovation**. The focus of my research was to create a recommendation system that enhances recipes by analyzing and suggesting ingredient combinations based on the number of shared flavor compounds between ingredients. By leveraging data on flavor compounds, this system aims to inspire new and innovative culinary creations.
